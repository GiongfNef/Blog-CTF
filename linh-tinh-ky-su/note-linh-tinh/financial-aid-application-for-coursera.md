# ðŸ’Ž Financial Aid Application for Coursera

## 1.Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)

```
Hello sir or madam
I am Truong Van Rong, i am a student from VietNam . I write this applying for coursera financial aid.

Honestly, i am studying IT at UIT (university at VietNam). I am extremely love your courses, i am learning about web3 with blockchain, smart contract knowledge. Because of the high quality of the courses offered by Coursera, I learnt about it through the recommendations of my instructors and friends. I learned on Coursera, where the knowledge system was laid out in a way that was very simple to comprehend for both beginners and experts. In addition, there are keywords that really assist me in the process of locating papers. I want to keep studying and take other Coursera courses because of this. However my family's financial situation, prevents me from paying for classes. Although my family usually makes an effort to ensure that their kids have access to school, the cost of the course is rather high in comparison to the average Vietnamese family's income, making this unfeasible., it wil support me very much for my studying and my future career. I am grateful if you will approve my applying and give me a chance to study this course.
I'm look forward to hearing from you. Thanks for reading 
Best Regards 
Truong Van Rong

## 2.How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals? (150 words minimum required)

```
Hello sir or madam

I picked up a lot of fundamental information at UIT University to create the groundwork for more advanced studies. When I first started studying information security at university, I was completely overwhelmed by the wealth of information. Most of the time, this was due to my lack of solid knowledge, which prevented me from learning more complex information. I will do a specific project this semester regarding smart contracts as I really want to understand about blockchain. I am certain that this course will provide me with information about Web3, blockchain technology, and smart contracts, which will be a huge assistance on my path.

This information source has been very helpful to me in reaching my broad aim of being a research specialist in the field of Web3 developer and pentester. I'm hoping that Coursera's financial aid program will enable me to more easily acquire knowledge. Inspiration to realize my goals. I promise to finish the course entirely if I receive it.

Best Regards 
Truong Van Rong
